# Mentor Matcher

A React-based web application for automating mentor-mentee matching with transparent scoring, admin controls, and simple tracking.

## Features

###  Core Functionality
- **CSV Upload**: Upload mentor and mentee data via drag-and-drop interface
- **Smart Matching**: Transparent algorithm with configurable scoring weights
- **Admin Controls**: Review matches, swap pairs, adjust thresholds  
- **Message Generation**: Customizable templates with variable substitution
- **Status Tracking**: Kanban-style interface for tracking pair progress

###  Matching Algorithm
Uses weighted scoring across multiple dimensions:
- **Skills Overlap (40%)**: Jaccard index between mentor skills and mentee preferred skills
- **Interest Overlap (20%)**: Jaccard index between shared interests
- **Availability (20%)**: Boolean overlap of time slots
- **Location (10%)**: String match for proximity
- **Capacity (10%)**: Mentor availability and load balancing

## Quick Start

### Installation
`ash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server  
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
`

### Usage Workflow
1. **Upload**: Add mentor and mentee CSV files (samples provided)
2. **Match**: Run algorithm with configurable threshold (40-80%)
3. **Review**: Examine pairs, swap if needed, view scoring rationale
4. **Messages**: Customize template, generate intro messages  
5. **Track**: Monitor pair status from Not Sent  Sent  Meeting Booked
